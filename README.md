# Obesity Determinants in Canada

This project analyzes the socioeconomic, lifestyle, and mental health factors associated with adult obesity in Canada using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS 2019–2020).

## Research Questions
1. How do socioeconomic factors (income and education level) predict obesity?  
2. How are lifestyle behaviours (physical activity and alcohol use) associated with obesity?  
3. How are psychosocial and health-related factors (stress levels) associated with obesity?
